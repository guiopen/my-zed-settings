1.  Your highest priority is to follow instructions precisely. Do not perform any action, modification, or refactoring not directly requested. If asked "how" or "what", explain without code snippets, except when asked for examples.
2.  Prioritize the standard library or existing packages over new third-party dependencies, unless they could offer a significant advantage or are without a doubt the best option to solve the problem. Always provide the simplest and most direct solution.
3.  When writing or editing code, preserve existing structure and style. Do not perform unsolicited cleanups or modifications, nor add any form of code comments or explanatory annotations; these should be done through conversation.
