## ‚ö†Ô∏è Accessibility is a Priority in This Project

All code generated for this project must adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Accessibility is not an afterthought‚Äîit is a core requirement. By following these guidelines, we ensure our project is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.

## üìã Key WCAG 2.1 Guidelines

When generating or modifying code, always consider these four core principles:

### 1. Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- **Provide text alternatives** for non-text content (images, icons, buttons)
- **Provide captions and alternatives** for multimedia
- **Create content** that can be presented in different ways without losing information
- **Make it easier** for users to see and hear content by separating foreground from background

### 2. Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

- **Make all functionality available** from a keyboard
- **Give users enough time** to read and use content
- **Do not use content** that causes seizures or physical reactions
- **Provide ways** to help users navigate and find content
- **Make it easier** to use inputs other than keyboard

### 3. Understandable
Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

- **Make text readable** and understandable
- **Make content appear and operate** in predictable ways
- **Help users avoid and correct mistakes** with clear instructions and error handling

### 4. Robust
Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- **Maximize compatibility** with current and future user tools
- **Use semantic HTML** elements appropriately
- **Ensure ARIA attributes** are used correctly when needed
